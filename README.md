# Bulk_SMS
Learning how to use Bulk SMS APIs effectively

# Inspiration behind the project

One of the things I needed to do during the first week was send bulk SMS to a few peopleðŸ˜€ (like 100ðŸ˜€ ). 

I didn't have access to the DB, and the contacts were shared on Excel.

The thought of doing this manually was exhausting. 

So I remembered an Africas Talking hackathon I attended last year which I had done through their bulk SMS docs.

Very nice Python script, but I needed to not hard code the phone numbers. So, I went back to the docs and decided to put the numbers on a JSON file.

Long story short, here are a few things I appreciated through this very small project:

1. The importance of asking users to format data a particular way at the point of collection (needless to say, it was extra work to change all the numbers into a working format on Excel).

2. The need for a simple Bulk SMS solution that you can set up in no time (possibly low or no code).

3. An affordable bulk SMS solution.

4. Good API documentation.

5. The ability to format the data at the database level before working with it.

Anyway, this very small project got me thinking a lot. The script I used is by no means perfect, but it's a work in progress.ðŸ˜„
